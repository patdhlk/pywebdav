Please update your installations!
```

## About ##

Python WebDAV implementation (level 1 and 2) that features a library that enables you
to integrate WebDAV server capabilities to your application.

A fully working example on how to use the library is included. You can find a server in the DAVServer package. This server is fully functional and can even be run as daemon.

If you search an easy to use WebDAV server that supports most clients (cadaver, Mac OS X Finder, Windows Explorer, ...) then try out PyWebDAV.

## Usecases ##

  * Calendar Server for iCal (tested on Mac OS X Tiger and Leopard)
  * Simple fileserver
  * Making your application support WebDAV

## Installation ##

Installation and setup of server can be as easy as follows:

```
$ easy_install PyWebDAV 
$ davserver -D /tmp -n -J
Starting up PyWebDAV server (version 0.9.2-dev)
>> ATTENTION: Authentication disabled!
>> Serving data from /tmp
>> Listening on localhost (8008)
```

If you're living on the bleeding edge then check out the sourcecode from
_http://pywebdav.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/_

```
$ svn co http://pywebdav.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ pywebdav
$ cd pywebdav
$ python setup.py develop
$ davserver --help
```

If you want to use the library then have a look at the DAVServer package that
holds all code for a full blown server. Also doc/ARCHITECURE has information for you.

## Additional notes ##

If you want MySQL based authentication then you need to install the following package and also configure the server using a configuration file.

MySQLdb (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python)

Look inside the file doc/TODO for things which needs to be done and will be done
in the near future. Have a look at doc/ARCHITECTURE to understand what's going on under the hood
